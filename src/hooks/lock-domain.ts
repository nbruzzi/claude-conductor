 * Lock-domain composition registry — per-phase lock-touching shape for
 * plugin-bundled checks (RE-W2-5 closure; Step F of Phase 3 substrate-completion
 * cycle 2026-05-12).
 *
 * Static-metadata only. Declares which lock-touching resources each
 * plugin-bundled check writes (or unlinks/renames). Consumers (current
 * session: none — additive-first per `feedback-live-substrate-sequencing.md`;
 * future cycles: race-surface analysis, lock-acquire ordering composition,
 * dotfiles-side framework consumers) can filter by `event` or `phase` to
 * derive an event-scoped view.
 *
 * Source-of-truth shape (v2.12 fold per ARCH-F-1):
 * - `LOCK_DOMAINS` — 10-literal const-array + `none` sentinel = 11 literals.
 * - `LockDomain` — closed literal-union derived from `LOCK_DOMAINS`.
 * - `BundledPhaseLockDomains` — row type `{ phase; event; domains; comment? }`.
 * - `BUNDLED_LOCK_DOMAINS_BY_EVENT` — event-keyed source-of-truth map
 *   (mirrors `bundled-check-names.ts:58-72` `BUNDLED_CHECKS_BY_EVENT` shape
 *   per sibling-parity discipline). `as const satisfies Record<HookEvent,
 *   readonly BundledPhaseLockDomains[]>` enforces compile-time HookEvent
 *   key-completeness — adding a new HookEvent without an entry is a
 *   compile error, not a runtime test failure.
 * - `BUNDLED_LOCK_DOMAINS` — flat array derived via `Object.values(...).flat()`,
 *   stays in sync automatically (matches `BUNDLED_CHECK_NAMES` derivation
 *   pattern at `bundled-check-names.ts:77-79`).
 *
 * Scope-decision (v2.11, ratified by Delta gate-2 sibling): ALL 11
 * plugin-bundled checks, event-tagged, NOT scoped to session-start only.
 * Reasoning: (a) registry-of-shape that gates session-start would leak
 * abstraction across the event boundary; (b) sibling-shape recurrence
 * vector preserved per `feedback-substrate-fix-pattern-must-self-mirror.md`
 * (Step E rented 4× on sibling-shape catches); (c) additive cost asymmetry
 * (widening = +4 rows; narrowing-then-widening = structural one-way door);
 * (d) framework-vs-library inversion alignment per
 * `feedback-framework-vs-library-inversion.md` — plugin publishes complete
 * shape; framework (dotfiles) consumes a filter.
 *
 * Empirical derivation: 10-domain taxonomy + `none` sentinel + 11-row matrix
 * derived via per-phase write-graph trace through `channels/index.ts` +
 * `channels/identity.ts` + `active-sessions/index.ts` + `worktrees/index.ts`
 * + `shared/presence-failure-log.ts`. Sweep-ordering is NOT encoded here —
 * that authority belongs to
 * `~/.claude-dotfiles/src/hooks/handlers/session-start.order.ts`
 * `SESSION_START_ORDER` per the dotfiles ORDER-file lookup pattern. This
 * registry expresses lock-touching shape; consumers compose ordering.
 *
 * Anti-drift discipline (8 invariants pinned by `test/hooks/lock-domain.test.ts`):
 * 1. **Exhaustive-coverage** — `BUNDLED_LOCK_DOMAINS` ↔ `BUNDLED_CHECK_NAMES`
 *    set-equality + 1:1 mapping. Adding a new bundled check without a row
 *    fails with a directed `expect.unreachable()` message.
 * 2. **Event-tag consistency** — each row's `event` matches the actual
 *    event-bucket in `BUNDLED_CHECKS_BY_EVENT`.
 * 3. **Event-keyed key completeness** — `BUNDLED_LOCK_DOMAINS_BY_EVENT` has
 *    a key for every `HookEvent` literal (enforced compile-time via
 *    `satisfies Record<HookEvent, ...>`; runtime test pins parity).
 * 4. **Domain-enum exhaustive** — every non-`none` LockDomain literal is
 *    referenced by ≥1 row (catches taxonomy drift).
 * 5. **`none` discipline** — rows with `domains: ["none"]` must have a
 *    non-empty `comment` (rationale-required per `feedback-self-sufficient-notes.md`).
 *    Currently 0 such rows (after RE-3 v2.12 fold moved `task-coordinator`
 *    to `presence-failure-log`).
 * 6. **Duplicate-detection between rows** — no two rows share the same `phase`.
 * 7. **Domain-uniqueness within row** (ARCH-F-3 v2.12 fold) — no row's
 *    `domains` list contains a duplicate.
 * 8. **Domains-non-empty** — every row has ≥1 domain (use `["none"]` for
 *    read-only baseline; currently no rows qualify).
 *
 * Pinned at `BUNDLED_CHECK_NAMES.length === 11` via
 * `test/hooks/bundled-registrations.test.ts:77` `EXPECTED_COUNT = 11`. When
 * `BUNDLED_CHECK_NAMES.length` changes upstream, `BUNDLED_LOCK_DOMAINS` row
 * count must change in lockstep — invariant #1 fires loudly on miss.
 *
 * Out of scope (v2.11; explicit deferrals filed for future cycles):
 * - Lock-acquire ordering enforcement (this slice is static metadata only).
 * - Cross-edge dotfiles consumer wiring (additive-first; follow-up cycle).
 *   Paired structural test at the exports-map boundary (per
 *   `feedback-cross-edge-contract-via-paired-tests.md`) lands with that cycle
 *   when the first dotfiles consumer is wired.
 * - `archiveChannel` whole-dir `renameSync` without `withMetadataLock`
 *   (substrate-fix concurrency hazard at `src/channels/index.ts:1276-1287`;
 *   backlog item — not Step F scope; the channel-gc row's wide domain set
 *   below DOCUMENTS the blast radius but does not fix the hazard).
 * - Dotfiles-side `withLock` consumers (8 distinct: branch-enforcement /
 *   dotfiles-catchup / dotfiles-commit / fact-force / memory-index-sync /
 *   output-externalization-nudge / vault-commit / vault-sync — substrate
 *   per INVERSIONS arc partition; not plugin-bundled).
