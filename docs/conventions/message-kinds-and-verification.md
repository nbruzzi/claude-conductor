# Channel message kinds + verification-budget convention

**Scope:** operator + developer reference for the 10 message kinds the
`claude-conductor channels send` verb accepts, with the verification
posture readers should apply per kind. First inhabitant of
`docs/conventions/`.

Plan: `~/.claude/plans/eventual-marinating-wall.md` v5 (Phase 4 Step A
Layer 3 + Layer 4).

## Kinds by phase

Kinds are stored as a single tuple in `src/channels/index.ts`
(`CHANNEL_KINDS`), with the type-level union `ChannelKind` derived from
it. Validator (`isChannelMessage`) and CLI acceptance (`VALID_KINDS`)
both read from the same tuple — single edit point, no drift.

### Phase 1 — informational + protocol carriers (4 kinds)

| Kind       | Semantic                                             | Recommended body                                                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `note`     | Informational; no reply expected.                    | Free-form prose.                                                                   |
| `question` | Expects a reply; sender awaits.                      | The question + any context the reader needs.                                       |
| `handoff`  | Full state transfer between sessions.                | Structured handoff (sections like "What shipped", "Next steps", "Open questions"). |
| `status`   | State-change announcement (posture / phase / ready). | One-line current state + any relevant SHA / run-id.                                |

### Phase 4 Step A Layer 3 — walkie-talkie protocol primitives (5 kinds)

These are low-bandwidth turn-taking signals between sibling sessions
coordinating via a channel. Each is intentionally short.

| Kind      | Semantic                                              | Recommended body                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ack`     | Receipt only — "I see your message"; no commitment.   | `received` or `ack` (1–10 chars).                                               |
| `roger`   | Receipt + commitment — "understood, will act."        | 1-line commitment (e.g. `will fold MAJOR-1 by next prompt`).                    |
| `over`    | Sender hint — "I posted, expecting reply."            | 1-line hint of expected reply (e.g. `your turn on L3`).                         |
| `standby` | Sender hint — "heard you, working, hold the channel." | 1-line reason (e.g. `running tests; ~5 min`).                                   |
| `out`     | Peer terminates this channel (additive).              | Reason for departure (e.g. `session ended` or `role transitioned to observer`). |

**Send-role-gate carve-out:** when a session's claimed `role === "out"`,
the CLI blocks every kind EXCEPT `kind=out`. The `out` kind is the one
allowed departure announcement from an already-departed peer.

**Terminal-until-takeover (RE-7):** once `metadata.identities[<L>].out_posted_at`
is set for an identity letter, the predicate `explicitlyOutPeers` continues
returning that letter on every read until a `claim --force` takeover replaces
the entire claim record. A departed peer does not auto-resurrect when its
session comes back; the next session (or an operator) must explicitly displace
the stale claim.

### Phase 4 Step A Layer 4 — mental-model-sync (1 kind)

| Kind     | Semantic                                                             | Recommended body                                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `digest` | Structured summary one session emits to peers or to its future self. | JSON conforming to `DigestBody` (see `src/channels/digest.ts`). |

The `digest` schema captures **what shipped + what was verified + what
audit-classes were paid + what's pickable next + what's blocking +
verification budget consumed**. The shared parser is `parseDigestBody`
(`src/channels/digest.ts`); any consumer reading `digest` messages
should use the shared parser rather than re-implementing JSON-parse +
shape-check.

## Verification-budget convention per kind

The verification a reader should apply varies by kind. The contract:

| Kind                                         | Reader's verification budget                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `note` / `status`                            | Trust verbatim.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `ack` / `roger` / `over` / `standby` / `out` | Trust verbatim. Protocol state, not assertions.                                                                                                                      |
| `question`                                   | Verify any factual claims the question relies on before answering.                                                                                                   |
| `handoff`                                    | Trust + verify against named SHAs / paths / run-ids before acting on the transfer.                                                                                   |
| `digest`                                     | Trust the SHAPE (validator-enforced); primary-source-verify any audit-class string, SHA, PR number, or backlog-item ID cited in the fields before reasoning forward. |

**Display-time sanitization hazard for `digest` field contents.** `parseDigestBody` enforces the SHAPE (six required fields, correct types, finite non-negative budget), but the parser is content-blind: `what_shipped[i]`, `audit_class_paid[i]`, `next_pickable`, and other string fields pass through unmodified. Any reader that renders `digest` field contents directly into an LLM system-reminder surface (cross-edge dotfiles consumers, future Phase 4 Step B reaper, analysis tooling) MUST sanitize at display time using the same defense Layer 1 `peer-message-deliverer` applies to peer-body content (UUID-nonce fence + platform-control-marker strip + bare-`<` escape — see `src/hooks/checks/peer-message-deliverer.ts` once Alpha lands A1). The shape-validation gate does NOT replace the display-time sanitization gate; readers writing digest field contents into LLM context surfaces are responsible for the second gate. Alpha sibling cross-audit MINOR-1 fold on the B2 staged diff.

**Why kind-specific verification:** the cost of misplaced trust scales
with the consequence. A `roger`'s commitment is checked when the
commitment lands (the reader sees the action, not the promise). A
`handoff`'s SHA citation drives cascade reasoning across files — wrong
SHA, wrong cascade. A `digest`'s `audit_class_paid` array tells the
reader what catch-shape was surfaced — wrong claim, wrong rent
accounting.

The convention applies to **automated readers** (cross-edge dotfiles
consumers, future Phase 4 Step B reaper, analysis tooling) as much as
to operators. Anywhere in the codebase that pattern-matches on a `digest`
body, `parseDigestBody` is the gate that enforces the shape; the
audit-class-string / SHA verification is the reader's responsibility per
this convention.
